# Benchmarks

Written by `./build.sh bench`. The numbers below are the engine benchmark's own output,
measured on the machine described here; they will differ on other machines.

## Results

# Benchmark run

- CPU: 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-12450H
- Logical cores: 12
- Compiler: 15.2.0
- Flags: -std=c++17 -O3 -DNDEBUG
- Threads are not pinned to cores.

## Queue: lock-free vs mutex

Items per producer: 200000. One consumer thread. Latency is the time inside `enqueue()`.

| Queue | Producers | Throughput (M items/s) | enqueue P50 (ns) | enqueue P99 (ns) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| lock-free | 1 | 2.07 | 87 | 6086 |
| mutex | 1 | 2.85 | 62 | 3000 |
| lock-free | 2 | 3.98 | 64 | 1692 |
| mutex | 2 | 5.70 | 40 | 2254 |
| lock-free | 4 | 3.70 | 432 | 3920 |
| mutex | 4 | 4.99 | 45 | 20564 |
| lock-free | 8 | 2.41 | 1289 | 26537 |
| mutex | 8 | 3.66 | 74 | 45319 |

## Order book: std::map vs dense array

1000000 operations (about 10% cancels) on one symbol, prices within +-10 cents of a drifting mid price. One thread.

| Book | Throughput (M ops/s) | P50 (ns) | P99 (ns) | Trades |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MapBook (std::map) | 10.12 | 114 | 402 | 822471 |
| DenseBook (array) | 14.82 | 84 | 347 | 822471 |

## Whole server, by engine flag

Measured over TCP by `engine/bench/server_bench.cpp`. RTT is send to ack. The matcher columns are
the server's own numbers, from queue push to matching finished; they show a backlog when the load is
more than the matching thread can take.

### Core pinning

4 connections, 30000 orders per run, 15 runs per configuration, paced at 2000 orders/s in total. Median over the runs; throughput also shows the slowest and fastest run.

| Configuration | Throughput (orders/s) | Range | RTT P50 (us) | RTT P99 (us) | RTT P99.9 (us) | Matcher P50 (us) | Matcher P99 (us) | Matcher P99 range |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| unpinned | 2000 | 1993 to 2000 | 183.8 | 1060.5 | 3667.1 | 58.5 | 1504.3 | 510 to 11118 |
| pinned | 2000 | 1999 to 2000 | 183.2 | 948.5 | 3311.8 | 52.5 | 1234.3 | 545 to 3877 |

4 connections, 200000 orders per run, 7 runs per configuration, closed loop, as fast as possible. Median over the runs; throughput also shows the slowest and fastest run. The matcher columns here are a backlog of seconds, not latency: this load is more than the matching thread can take.

| Configuration | Throughput (orders/s) | Range | RTT P50 (us) | RTT P99 (us) | RTT P99.9 (us) | Matcher P50 (us) | Matcher P99 (us) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| unpinned | 15358 | 14654 to 15642 | 219.4 | 1009.9 | 1582.2 | 2381441.4 | 3930215.8 |
| pinned | 15711 | 14736 to 15978 | 214.2 | 986.9 | 1493.1 | 2330488.2 | 3849743.9 |
